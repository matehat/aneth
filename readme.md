A quick and dirty utility that uses Zeroconf to advertize its host machine with a specified hostname
on the network. It can also listen for these advertisements and manage `/etc/hosts` accordingly,
so that machines are automatically accessible by their provided hostname from any member running
that script.

## Usage

```bash
$ aneth start <hostname> [-s|--service <serviceName>] [-w|--watch] [-p|--port port] [-A|--aliases aliases]
```

* You can provide a `serviceName` parameter that will be used to listen for advertisements. 
Otherwise, `aneth-hosts` will be used.

* The `--watch` options tells Aneth to watch for advertised hosts on the network and modify
`/etc/hosts` accordingly (you'll need to execute that with `sudo` for it to work).

* The `--port` options is for specifying the port number to use to advertise the current machine.

* The `--aliases` options is set of local hostname aliases in the form of 

        --aliases from.some.domain:to.other.domain,another.one:to.another.one

```bash
$ aneth install <hostname> [--service <serviceName>] [--watch]
```

This will install Aneth so it is started on each system reboots, with the provided configurations. Currently, only Mac OS X is supported, simply using a [launchd.plist(5)][1]. I know it should work pretty easily on Linux too, but I'm no expert enough to provide a proper, portable solution. Currently, I'm simply creating a [dead-simple][3] [runit][2] setup. I'm kinda lazy, I know. You are very welcome to fork and submit a patch that would include generating and installing a generic init script (or anything really).

## Installation

You will need to install globally if you want the `aneth` executable accessible anywhere.

```bash
$ npm install -g aneth
```

On Mac, it will just work. On a linux machine, you need to install Avahi, a [Bonjour
compatibility library](https://github.com/agnat/node_mdns#installation).

Enjoy.
