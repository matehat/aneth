{"name":"Aneth","tagline":"Quick and Dirty zeroconf cluster","body":"A quick and dirty utility that uses Zeroconf to advertize its host machine with a specified hostname\r\non the network. It can also listen for these advertisements and manage `/etc/hosts` accordingly,\r\nso that machines are automatically accessible by their provided hostname from any member running\r\nthat script.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ aneth start <hostname> [-s|--service <serviceName>] [-w|--watch] [-p|--port port] [-A|--aliases aliases]\r\n```\r\n\r\n* You can provide a `serviceName` parameter that will be used to listen for advertisements. \r\nOtherwise, `aneth-hosts` will be used.\r\n\r\n* The `--watch` options tells Aneth to watch for advertised hosts on the network and modify\r\n`/etc/hosts` accordingly (you'll need to execute that with `sudo` for it to work).\r\n\r\n* The `--port` options is for specifying the port number to use to advertise the current machine.\r\n\r\n* The `--aliases` options is set of local hostname aliases in the form of \r\n\r\n        --aliases from.some.domain:to.other.domain,another.one:to.another.one\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ aneth install <hostname> [--service <serviceName>] [--watch]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will install Aneth so it is started on each system reboots, with the provided configurations. Currently, only Mac OS X is supported, simply using a [launchd.plist(5)][1]. I know it should work pretty easily on Linux too, but I'm no expert enough to provide a proper, portable solution. Currently, I'm simply creating a [dead-simple][3] [runit][2] setup. I'm kinda lazy, I know. You are very welcome to fork and submit a patch that would include generating and installing a generic init script (or anything really).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nYou will need to install globally if you want the `aneth` executable accessible anywhere.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ npm install -g aneth\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn Mac, it will just work. On a linux machine, you need to install Avahi, a [Bonjour\r\ncompatibility library](https://github.com/agnat/node_mdns#installation).\r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nhttp://wtfpl.org\r\n\r\n[1]: http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man5/launchd.plist.5.html\r\n[2]: http://smarden.org/runit/\r\n[3]: https://gist.github.com/4652791","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
